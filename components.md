# Components

Components are reusable building blocks that combine **colour**, **typography**, **spacing**, and **interaction behaviour** into consistent UI patterns.

Each component in this section documents:

- **Purpose** – what the component is for
- **Variants** – primary, secondary, destructive, etc.
- **Anatomy** – the essential parts of the component
- **Behaviour** – hover, focus, active, disabled states
- **Accessibility** – keyboard and screen reader expectations
- **Current implementation** – how it works today in the product
- **Token usage** – how the component applies the colour and type tokens defined in Foundations

This section is intentionally incremental.  
Components can be added one at a time as we document or modernise them.
